## Discription 
• Use types of geometry shapes available in the Three.js library to render the planet, 
Saturn’s iconic rings, and a few of its moons. 

• The scene should be properly lit with necessary shadow effects. 

• There should be a representation of the sun that emits light to the scene. 

• All the used geometries should have appropriate textures added to them.

• There should be a normal and/or bump map added to the textures. 

• Add particle effects by adding and rendering randomized asteroids.

• Add a skybox to represent a starry galaxy. 

• Implement a control system to navigate the scene. 

• Add the following animations to the scene. 

    • Rotation of Saturn and moons around their axes. 

    • Moons orbiting around Saturn. 

• A portion of marks will be allocated for completeness. You can add things like models of 
spaceships, randomized effects such as comets, or even adding more planets, etc. to refine 
your scene.

• Browse the freely available online platforms for textures, models, etc.
